**All OH (Office Hour) times are PDT (Pacific Daylight Time).**

I (Jeremy) and the uGSIs are very excited to have you guys this semester.
We (Jeremy and uGSIs) recognize this course is often taken by Berkeley
business and economics majors as a prerequisite, so we are excited to
learn from your backgrounds. We also want to welcome the numerous
Visiting Domestic and International Students among us; we hope you enjoy
your time in the Bay Area and that this course can be a part of that!
Our goal is to give you a first foundation in statistics that you can
use throughout your careers in whatever field they might be and in life,
too.

The goal of this course is to construct and critique claims made using
data. The types of claim we will be discussing are: descriptive,
generalizations, causal, and predictive.

The course is structured by week. Each week will focus on a particular
subject, and all the assignments for that subject will be
due at the end of the "course week," which begins on **Monday at
12:00am** and ends **every Sunday at 11:59pm**. **The two exceptions to this rule are the first week of class (June 20th) and the third week of class (July 4th). For these weeks, assignments will be released Tuesday 12:00am.** This way, you guys will not have assignments due regarding one topic and yet have to go to lecture and labs where we talk about another. But if you have questions
about previous weeks' material, you can ask us during lab and lecture!

Here is a list of the main course topics, separated by week and with
type of statistical claim in parentheses.

-   Week 1: Introduction, types of data, and reproducible research
-   Week 2: Descriptive Statistics (Descriptive)
-   Week 3: Generalizations and Probability (Generalizations)
-   Week 4: Midterm Review and Midterm
-   Week 5: Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests (Generalizations)
-   Week 6: Experimental Design (Causal)
-   Week 7: Linear Regression (Predictive)
-   Week 8: Review & Final, Special Topics

En route to learning these topics, we'll also discuss:

-   Probability and random variable notation
-   Resampling procedures

And all of these will be explored traditionally and by coding methods (R
and RStudio)!

### Culture

Students taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope
to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment **based on
curiosity rather than competition**. Therefore, all members of the
course community are expected to treat each other with courtesy and
respect.

You will be interacting with us (Jeremy and uGSIs) and fellow students in
several different environments. Some of these will be in person, some
online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be
professional.

If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other
students, please come talk to us about it. If you are concerned with
issues created by myself or a uGSI, please speak with me (Jeremy).

*See Miscellaneous - On Confidentiality and Miscellaneous - Campus
Resources*.

### Mode of Instruction

In-person. This is subject to change with fluctuations in the COVID-19
pandemic.

### Lecture

I will meet you guys on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at
11:00a in Hearst Memorial Mining Building, Room 390.

If you miss the lectures, go ahead and read over the
slides and ask questions on the class forum. This should allow you to
catch up!

***There is no lecture on Monday, June 20***. Happy Juneteenth!

***There is no lecture on Monday, July 4***. Happy Independence Day!

### Labs

Lab sections will be held by the GSI in Evans Hall 342 on Monday,
Wednesday, and Thursday. There are three sections: Section 1, Section 2,
and Section 3, held at 1:00p, 2:00p, and 3:00p, respectively.

These sections are meant to help you complete the (mostly) weekly lab
assignments and serve as review periods on test weeks, so please do
attend! This is also a great opportunity to meet and collaborate with
your classmates.

If you are ill or have been exposed to illness (including and not
limited to COVID-19), please do not come to lab. Feel free to post on the class forum and visit virtual office hours!

### Materials

There are no outright required materials for this course. However, we
will be drawing from some materials so you should be aware of them. I will also give the abbreviations that I use on the *Schedule* page where the readings for each lecture will be posted.

The primary textbook associated with this course is [Introduction to
Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) **IMS** by
Çetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. This is a free online textbook that can
also be downloaded as a [pdf](https://leanpub.com/imstat) or ordered in
[print](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Statistics-Mine-%C3%87etinkaya-Rundel/dp/1943450145/)
for \$15. 

The following texts are valuable supplementary texts and will be drawn
upon for additional readings:

-   [Statistics](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393929720) **STA**, Freedman,
    Pisani, and Purves
-   [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/) **DVS**,
    Healy
-   [Hands-on Programming with
    R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) **HOP**, Grolemund
-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) **RDS**, Wickham and Grolemund

### Programming

Learning some form of computer programming is essential for modern
statistics and data analysis. If you are not familiar with any
programming, **that's ok*.*** Most students taking Stat 20 are in your
shoes and we'll teach you everything you need to know!

The software that we'll be using is the free and open-source language
called *R* that we'll be interacting with via software called *RStudio*.
As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you
for at: <http://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu>.

### Course communication

#### Discussion forum

The class forum will be held on [Ed](https://edstem.org). Keep an eye
out for an e-mail invite in the first week of classes.

We have this forum so you can ask and answer questions with your fellow
students and course staff. It's really useful for staying up-to-date
with the course and learning from your classmates.

We'd also prefer that you communicate with us on *Ed*. How you can do
that is by making a new post and flagging it as private.

#### Course website

All of the assignments will be posted on this website,
[https://stat20summer.netlify.app](https://stat20summer.netlify.app). The website also
holds the course syllabus, extra resources, and staff information.

#### Email

If you have a question about the course logistics and content, go ahead
and post it without the private setting to the class forum.

We'd love for you to e-mail us regarding issues of an individual and
private matter, if you're not comfortable with using the private setting
on *Ed*.

### Assignments, Exams, and Grading

#### Problem Sets and Labs

There are two main assignment types in this class. They will be released
together (mostly) **every Monday**.

The **problem set** is meant to *practice* the concepts and methods from lecture. They will read more like a traditional homework assignment than the lab, with questions on various topics. I also intend the problem sets to serve as study material for exams and quizzes, too.

Because they are practice, **they will not be graded**, and a walkthrough solution video will be posted one week after their release. There will be six problem sets.

**Labs**  are the main assignment of the
course. They are meant to apply the concepts from lecture in the cause of
doing an analysis of real data. Unlike the problem set, they will typically focus on one data set/question.

They will involve both writing code and regularly. There will be
six labs. Labs will be due on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)
**at the end of the course week, Sunday, 11:59p**.

Gradescope is really awesome and you can return there to get feedback on
your work or to file a regrade request if you you notice that we made an
error in applying the rubric to your work.

#### Late Work

As another part of trying to lasso each section of the course into its
week, late work will not be accepted. However, we 
recognize there are things going on in each of your lives which you
might need to handle throughout the course.

Because of this, when it comes to labs, we're going to give you **one
drop** and **one two-day extension (until the following Tuesday,
11:59p)**, no questions asked. Here are some rules:

1.  These will be used separately, one per lab. For example, you can
    drop Lab 1 and extend Lab 3.
2.  You must use the drop before the extension.
3.  You must notify me of your wish to use the lab drop / extension by
    **the due date of the lab (Sunday, 11:59p)**.

#### Quizzes

As a precursor to the midterm and final, we will have remote quizzes.
There will be two editions, an original and a retake.

The originals will be released on **Thursday, July 7** and **Thursday,
August 4**, respectively, at **6:00p**.

You will have 25 minutes to take the quiz sometime between **Thu 6:00p**
and **Fri 5:59p**, at which time the answers will be unlocked. Make sure
you start with at least 25 minutes to go!

The retakes will be released on **Sat 6:00p** (a day after the first
quiz answers are released) and you have 25 minutes until **Sun 5:59p**
to complete it.

This is an individual assignment, so while taking the quiz please don't
collaborate with others. You are welcome to study between the first two
quiz takes with others, however.

#### Tests

The midterm will be held on **Thursday, July 14** at the normal class
time and location.

The final will be held on **Wednesday, August 10**, also at the normal
class time and location. It will primarily focus on the material covered
after the midterm.

You can have one two-sided cheatsheet for the midterm, and two for the
final. Just make sure they are only comprised of your handwriting. You
don't have to turn them in after the test.

There will be a clobber policy. What this means is that you can replace
your midterm score with your final score if you want to. Our plan is to
release midterm grades by **Sunday, July 17**. Once the grades are
released, if you want to use the clobber policy, e-mail me by 
**Sunday,July 24**.

#### Grading

Your final grade in the course will be computed based on:

-   Labs 50%
-   Problem sets 0%
-   Quiz 1 5%
-   Quiz 2 5%
-   Midterm 20%
-   Final 20%

I made the labs the majority of the grade because the main takeaway of
the class should be your ability to do data analysis in a semi-formal
setting.

There is no curve, so you don't need to worry about this.

#### Collaboration policy

You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem
sets and labs, but the labs you turn in should reflect your own
understanding and **all of your collaborators must be cited (first and
last name) in a full sentence before the first question on your lab**.
Example: *I collaborated with Qinqyi Fang, Dev Navani and Wayne Wang
on this assignment.* **Please make sure your collaborators have added
you as well in their sentence.** Also, your quiz and test submissions
must reflect only your work.

Students may not circulate or post non-public materials (tests, quizzes,
lecture recordings-any private class materials) from the class without
the written permission of the instructor. Lecture recordings must also
not be posted publicly because that violates laws protecting the privacy
of students featured in the lecture.

We all need help sometimes. In fact, some forms of help, like googling
the text of an error message, are almost necessary for you to learn
self-reliance when it comes to the coding portion of the course. In that
vein:

The following examples of collaboration **are** allowed (and
encouraged).

-   Working on labs with your friends and other students in the class,
    **WITH proper citation by both parties** **as described above**.
    Make sure that your write-ups are **your words only**.
-   Copying small snippets (a few lines) of code from answers on
    websites such as *Stack Overflow*, **WITH proper citation**.
-   Using ideas from snippets of code from answers on websites such
    *Stack Overflow* to make analogous code to these answers for your
    specific situation, **WITH proper citation**.
-   Discussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.
-   Showing your code to a classmate along with an error message or
    confusing output.
-   Posting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking
    help.
-   Helping other students solve questions on the discussion with
    conceptual pointers or snippets of code that don't give away the
    entire answer.

The following disallowed behaviors include, but are not limited to:

-   Working on labs with your friends and other students in the class
    **WITHOUT proper citation by both parties as described above.** This
    includes situations where you cite someone else but they do not cite
    you.
-   Copying small snippets of code (a few lines) from answers on
    websites such as *Stack Overflow*, **WITHOUT proper citation**.
-   Using ideas from snippets of code from answers on websites such
    *Stack Overflow* to make analogous code to these answers for your
    specific situation, **WITHOUT proper citation**.
-   Copying entire chunks of code from answers on websites such as
    *Stack Overflow*, **WITH OR WITHOUT** **proper citation**.
-   Leaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot)
    where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this
    include websites like *Course Hero* and *Chegg*, on a group chat,
    over *Discord/Slack*, or in a file passed on to future students.
-   Accessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other
    students distributed as above.
-   Submitting work on an exam or a quiz that indicates you used the
    work of outside resources or other students.

If you have questions about the boundaries of our policy, please ask us;
there is no penalty for doing this.

I know this is a lot, so here is a TL;DR:

-   For labs: **you need to cite everything** that doesn't come out
    of your own brain or from STAT 20 Summer 2022 course material, and
    that **you cannot copy and paste entire solutions to a problem
    or subproblem on a lab that don't come from either your own brain or
    from STAT 20 Summer 2022 course material.**

-   For quizzes, **no collaboration with other people or Internet
    sources**.

-   For exams, **no collaboration with other people or Internet
    sources.**

#### More on Cheating

To check for cheating, we use *Turnitin* for labs and have access to
data through *Gradescope* to detect cheating on quizzes. We will also be
proctoring exams remotely and in-person.

Students determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by
the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the
course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First
violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii)
Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational
interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.

If you have questions about the boundaries of our policy, please ask us;
there is no penalty for doing this.

#### What do I do if I start the course late?

If you join the course late, we encourage you to look through past
lecture slides and do the previous assignments as best as you can, even
if the due dates have since passed and they can no longer be submitted.
Reading through the posts on the discussion forum is a good place to
start. We'd also love to meet your during office hours.

### Miscellaneous (Please Read)

#### Accommodations for students with disabilities

We want all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations
from the Disabled Students' Program, please share them with me as soon
as possible, and I will work out the necessary arrangements. For those
of you who receive extended time on timed assessments, the time period
you have to take the online quiz will be automatically extended
accordingly. You'll also take the midterm and final through the campus
proctoring service, which will provide extended time.

#### On Confidentiality

If you wish to talk to us about incidents of sexual violence, sexual
harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy, we are
here for you. However, please know that:

*As UC employees, I and the uGSIs are "Responsible Employees" and are
therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual
harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the
Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual
violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests
for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources
available to you through UCB's PATH to Care Center, which serves
survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care
Line at 510-643-2005.*
