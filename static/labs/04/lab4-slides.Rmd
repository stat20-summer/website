# Day 1

# Question 1

---

## Question 1 parts a-c (5 min.)

a. What was the goal(s) of the Chancellor’s office in commissioning this survey?

--

b. To which population does the Chancellor’s office wish to generalize their findings?

--

c. Describe two parameters that the Chancellor’s office is trying to estimate using the survey data.

--

---

## Question 1 parts d-f (15 min.)

d. What was the initial sample size of students selected to take the survey? What was the final sample size that actually did? What was the response rate?

--

e. Describe one scenario wherein this response rate would lead to results that they could not generalize from the sample to the population. Be specific.

--

f. Sketch a plot of what the data might look like that is generated by Question 18 and 21. These two questions together show the change before and after participants were given basic information on the People’s Park project.

---

## Question 1 parts g-i (10 min.)

g. Create the visualization of part f using the questionnaire data. Add a title and axis labels. Then, describe the distribution in words.

--

h. Create a new column called `support_before` that takes the response data from question 18 and returns `TRUE` for answers of `“Very strongly support”`, `“Strongly support”`, and `“Somewhat support”` and `FALSE` otherwise. What proportion of the survey participants in each class (freshman, sophomore, etc) supported the People’s Park Project before being presented with the information on the bottom of page 14?

--

i. Create a new column called `change_in_support` that measures the change in support from question 18 to 21. What is the average change in support of the survey participants in each class (freshman, sophomore, etc) for the People’s Park Project after reading the information?

---

## Question 1 parts j-k (10 min.)

j. Create a 95% confidence interval for the overall proportion of students that support the People’s Park Project without having been exposed to the information on page 14. Interpret the interval in the context of the problem.

--

k. Create a 95% confidence interval for the overall change in support the Project before and after being exposed to the information on page 14. Does the interval contain 0? What are the implications of that for those working in the Chancellor’s Office on the People’s Park Project?
