Please get into groups of 3 (4 is ok too). Take turns introducing yourselves.
These will be your partners for Questions 1 and 2.

# Question 1 - Setting up your experiment

-  Have a group member with a tablet write your answers on a digital version of this document, or have a group member write your answers on a scanned version of the paper document.

- Your answers to this question, along with your answers to Question 2 will be submitted as a *group submission* to *Lab 5 - Group Portion* on Gradescope.

- Work at your own pace today. The recommended times are there to help you out. We will come by and guide you where necessary.

## Lab 5

**Your challenge this week**: Determine whether or not one of your group members can distinguish between two different types of sparkling water (or a similar claim *of your choosing*).

## Lab 5 - Logistics

.pull-left[
```{r echo= FALSE}

]

.pull-right[

### Each team will have

- 50 minutes (lab Wednesday)
- 2 cans of sparkling water, each one from a different flavor
- small cups

- saltine crackers
]

## Group Members

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/members.png")
```

--

-   Choose a Taster, a Materials Handler, and one (two) facilitator(s).

---

## Claim and Hypotheses (rec. 10 mins)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/claim.png")
```

- **Remember from Week 1**: Your question directly influences the data you will collect! Be specific enough that you can envision a data frame that will record your experiment data based off of your question.

---

## Protocol (rec 20 mins.)

-   Be specific! You *must* be able to pass this protocol off to another group so they could carry out your intended experiment with no confusion.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/protocol.png")
```

---

## Data (rec 10 mins.)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/data.png")
```


---

## Graphics (rec 10 mins.)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/eda.png")
```

---

## Things to remember

- Be precise in your protocol.

- For Wednesday's lab, meet outside Evans Hall.
