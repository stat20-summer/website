# The $Normal$ distribution

## The $Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ distribution

-   By far, the most important distribution in statistics.

-   Normal distributions are symmetric and bell-shaped.

-   Normal distributions are governed by two parameters: $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

-   Normal distributions are *continuous* rather than *discrete.*

. . . 

## The $Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ distribution

-   The parameters of the Normal distribution are quite special in that:

    -   The mean of a Normal distribution is given by $\mu$
    
    -   The standard deviation of a Normal distribution is given by $\sigma$
    
        -   You may also see the parametrization $Normal(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^2$ is the variance 
        
. . . 

## The $Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ distribution

-   When you increase/decrease the value of $\mu$, you *shift* right/left the distribution, respectively.

-   When you increase/decrease the value of $\mu$, you *widen/narrow* the distribution, respectively. 

    -   This widening/narrowing can be more generally called *scaling*.

. . . 

## The $Normal$ distribution: Examples

- The $Normal(\mu = 75, \sigma = 5)$ Distribution:

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.dim= c(10,8)}
library(tidyverse)
fun_range <- c(60, 90)
Fun_Range_Df <- tibble(fun_range)

ggplot(Fun_Range_Df) + geom_area(mapping = aes(x = fun_range),
                                 stat = "function",
                                     fun = dnorm, 
                                     args = list(75, 5),
                                     fill = "navyblue",
                                 color = "aquamarine",
                                 alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_light() + xlab("x") + ylab("P(X = x)") + 
  ggtitle("The Normal(mu = 75, sigma = 5) distribution")

```

## The $Normal$ distribution : Examples

- The $Normal(\mu = 600, \sigma = 10)$ Distribution:

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.dim= c(12,8)}
library(tidyverse)
fun_range <- c(560, 640)
Fun_Range_Df <- tibble(fun_range)

ggplot(Fun_Range_Df) + geom_area(mapping = aes(x = fun_range),
                                 stat = "function",
                                     fun = dnorm, 
                                     args = list(600, 10),
                                     fill = "gold",
                                 color = "orange",
                                 alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_light() + xlab("x") + ylab("P(X = x)") + 
  ggtitle("The Normal(mu = 600, sigma = 10) distribution")

```

## The $Normal$ distribution 

-   Indeed, there are an infinite number of possible $Normal$ distributions we can make.

-   Since we will collect data with many different values for center and spread, it seems like if we want to do inference using a $Normal$ distribution, we will have to be able calculate probabilities for all of the possible $Normal$ distributions that could arise.

. . . 

## The $Normal$ distribution

-   For a very surface-level insight as to why that might be problematic, here is the *probability density function* for the $Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ distribution.

. . . 

$$ f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$ 

. . . 

## The $Normal$ distribution

-   What we need is a universal method to calculate $Normal$ probabilities for a distribution with an arbitrary $\mu$ and $\sigma$. Does such a method exist?

. . . 

## The $Normal$ distribution

-   The answer is a resounding **yes**! The key lies in shifting and scaling a given $Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ distribution by special values.

-   If we *shift* the distribution by its mean $\mu$ and *scale* it by its standard deviation $\sigma$, we will always achieve the following $Normal$ distribution.

. . . 

## The $Normal(\mu = 0, sigma = 1)$ distribution

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.dim= c(12,8)}
library(tidyverse)
fun_range <- c(-4, 4)
Fun_Range_Df <- tibble(fun_range)

ggplot(Fun_Range_Df) + geom_area(mapping = aes(x = fun_range),
                                 stat = "function",
                                     fun = dnorm, 
                                     args = list(0, 1),
                                     fill = "gold",
                                 color = "forestgreen",
                                 alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_light() + xlab("x") + ylab("P(X = x)") + 
  ggtitle("The Normal(mu = 0, sigma = 1) distribution")

```

-   This $Normal$ distribution is so important that we call it the **standard $Normal$ distribution.**

. . . 

## The standard $Normal$ distribution

-   The **standard $Normal$ distribution** has historically been much easier to calculate probabilities with than other $Normal$ distributions.

-   Therefore, our first goal when trying to work with $Normal$ distributions is to first *standardize* them so that they have mean 0 and standard deviation (variance) 1.

-   We denote the random variable belonging to the standard $Normal$ distribution by $Z$.

. . . 

# Calculating probabilities with the $Normal$ distribution

## Calculating probabilities with the $Normal$ distribution

-   Steps:

1. Frame our problem in the context of the **standard $Normal$ distribution**. 

    -   This means shifting by $\mu$ and scaling by $\sigma$:
    
    -   $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

2. Calculate the probability using a standard $Normal$ probability table or with R.

. . . 

## Calculating probabilities with the $Normal$ distribution - Example

> Field goal percentages of NBA players during the 2021-22 season were roughly $Normal$lly distributed with parameters $\mu = 0.44$ and $\sigma = 0.1$.

. . . 

> What is the probability that an NBA player during this season would record a field goal percentage of 60 percent or greater?

. . . 

## Calculating probabilites with the $Normal$ distribution 

-   Steps:

. . . 

1. $$ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{.6 - .44}{.10} = 1.6 $$

  -  Now, we want $P(Z > 1.6)$
  
2. Use the function `pnorm()` in R to calculate this probability.

. . . 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
1 - pnorm(q = 1.6)
```
. . . 

## Calculating probabilites with the $Normal$ distribution 

-   Why did we do `1 - pnorm(q = 1.6)` rather than just `pnorm(q = 1.6)`?

## Calculating probabilites with the $Normal$ distribution 

-   `pnorm()` is calculating $P(Z \leq z)$!

-   We want $P(Z > z)$ , therefore, we need to perform $1 - P(Z \leq z)$ to get the correct probability.

. . . 

## Calculating probabilites with the $Normal$ distribution 

- In R, we can also achieve the same result programatically by including the argument `lower.tail = FALSE` in our call to `pnorm()`.

. . . 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pnorm(q = 1.6, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
. . . 

## Calculating probabilites with the $Normal$ distribution - Your turn

> What is the probability that an NBA player during this season would record a field goal of exactly 30 percent?

. . . 

## Calculating probabilites with the $Normal$ distribution - Your turn

> What is the probability that an NBA player during this season would record a field goal of exactly 30 percent?

. . . 

-   The $Normal$ distribution is  a *continuous distribution* with infinitely many values on the real line! We can only talk about probabilities with inequalities in this situation.

. . . 


## Calculating probabilites with the $Normal$ distribution - Your turn

> What is the probability that an NBA player during this season would record a field goal percentage of 30 percent or less?

## Visualizing probabilities with the $Normal$ distribution

. . . 

-   With your row, discuss how you would visualize this probability. Then come to the front with a pencil or pen and sketch a visualization on the provided piece of paper.

# Performing hypothesis tests using the $Normal$ distribution

## Performing hypothesis tests using the $Normal$ distribution

> In the 2021-2022 season, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded a field goal percentage of 55.3 percent. I therefore claim that Giannis has a better field goal shooting percentage than the average player, who clocked in at around just 43 percent. 

. . . 

- How can we test this claim with a significance level of $\alpha = 0.1$?

. . . 

## Performing hypothesis tests using the $Normal$ distribution

$$ H_0: fgp_{Giannis} = 0.44 $$

$$ H_A: fgp_{Giannis} > 0.44 $$
. . . 

Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of field goal percentages in the NBA for the 2021-22 season is $Normal(\mu = 0.44, \sigma = .1)$.

. . . 

## Performing hypothesis tests using the $Normal$ distribution

-   Exercise: 

    -   Visualize $P(FGP > 0.553)$ based on distribution of field goal percentages under the null hypothesis.

    -   Calculate $P(FGP > 0.553)$.


    -   This probability is in fact the *p-value* (why?). Then make a conclusion as to whether Giannis is a better field goal shooter than the average player based on the evidence.
